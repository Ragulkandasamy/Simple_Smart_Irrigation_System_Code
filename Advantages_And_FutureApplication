ADVANTAGES
●	The increasing food demands involves rapid improvement of the food and the development of food production systems.
●		Thus, to enhance the quality of the crop people are moving towards the modern cultivation techniques.
●		Thus aeroponics is one of the rising technology in agriculture. To maintain this the proper management of crop is essential.
●	The aeroponic system can be developed with a wireless sensor.
●	The advantages include faster response and best quality control that produces lower labour cost.
●	It provides the full control of the system not simply by the manual attention but to a large extent by the wireless sensors.

FUTURE APPLICATIONS
●	Artificial intelligence agricultural techniques are considered to be the high improving techniques.
●		Aeroponics is the most developing plant cultivation technology for agriculture.
●	Agriculture is one of the primitive applications which is started by humans on earth. Presently, the technology is considered to be key tool for overcoming many challenges.
●	The principle of artificial intelligence is that a machine can perceive its environment through certain capacity of flexible rationality.
